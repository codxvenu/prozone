      <p>7. You can buy only through checker and only valid cards. We understand that checkers can kill cards but it kills not more than 20% so you will get minimum of 80% validity at the end point and cheap price will cover your losses!!!</p>
      <p>8. Some bases are NON REFUNDABLE and have no check time or CHECK option those cards from higher valid rate bases but not 100% valid.

We also provide you the option to search and find ONLY REFUNDABLE or NONREFUNDABLE cards, you can filter those options in EXTENDED OPTION filter.</p>
      <p>9. If the Card is "Approved", you pay a fee of $1 per check. If the card is "Declined", you pay nothing for check and you get auto-refund!</p>
